# Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio, where I present a collection of projects that highlight my extensive expertise and proficiency in various data analytical skills. 
Each project in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to tackle diverse analytical challenges, employ programming languages like Python or SQL with relevant statistical techniques, and derive actionable insights from complex datasets. 

Please explore the individual projects in this portfolio for a more detailed understanding of my data analytics capabilities and how I can contribute to your organization's success.

**[1. AIDS-Censoring-ML-Classifiers](https://github.com/maidinh2409/AIDS-ML-Classification)**

This is a dataset from the medical industry that contains data of patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS who are participating in a study with the goal of observing whether or not each patient died within a certain observation time. The purpose is to examine the performance of two different types of AIDS treatments (with ZDV treatments and no ZDV treatments)
- Tools used: Python
- Models: Logistics Regression, Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree

**[2. Gym Check-ins and User Metadata](https://github.com/maidinh2409/Gym-Check-ins-and-User-Metadata)**

This dataset contains information on user check-ins at different gym locations, along with related user metadata. The data is relatively clean and was used to practice building data models, standardizing fields, and extracting and querying information across multiple tables for analysis and visualization purposes. The focus was on performing various analyses and creating insights based on the gym check-in data.
  - Tools used: MySQL, Tableau
    
**[2. Real Estate Sales Analysis 2001 - 2022](https://github.com/maidinh2409/Real-Estate-Sales-Analysis)**

This dataset, sourced from data.gov, contains over 1 million rows of real estate sales data spanning 21 years. It was utilized to clean and transform data using pandas, addressing null values, resolving inconsistencies, and detecting outliers through statistical analysis and visualization. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot and analyze distributions, patterns, and trends, yielding insights based on metrics and distribution theory.
  - Tool used: Python

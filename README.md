# Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio, where I present a collection of projects that highlight my extensive expertise and proficiency in various data analytical skills. 
Each project in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to tackle diverse analytical challenges, employ programming languages like Python or SQL with relevant statistical techniques, and derive actionable insights from complex datasets. 

Please explore the individual projects in this portfolio for a more detailed understanding of my data analytics capabilities and how I can contribute to your organization's success.

**[1. Exoplanet Habitability Analysis](https://github.com/maidinh2409/Exoplanet-Hability-Analysis)**

**<ins>Description:</ins>** End-to-end project assessing exoplanet habitability using real astronomical data. I structured the workflow into three stages:

- **Data Extraction**: Collected data via NASA and Asterank APIs
- **ELT Pipeline**: Used dbt + BigQuery to clean, transform, and validate planetary features
- **BI & ML Deployment**:
  + Built a Power BI dashboard to explore habitability patterns
  + Trained XGBoost and logistic regression models to classify planets

**<ins>Purpose:</ins>** To apply real-world tools and best practices in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning on a space science problem, delivering both actionable insights and a scalable classification system.

**<ins>Expected insights:</ins>** Readers will gain a deeper understanding of planetary habitability by identifying clusters of potentially habitable exoplanets based on star system attributes, spatial location, and physical characteristics. Machine learning models are leveraged to predict habitability likelihood with interpretable metrics and deployment-ready logic.

**<ins>Tech Stack:</ins>**

- Languages: Python, SQL
- Tools: dbt, Google BigQuery, Power BI, RESTFul APIs (NASA, Asterank)

**[2. AIDS-Survivor-ML-Classifiers](https://github.com/maidinh2409/AIDS-ML-Classification)**

**<ins>Description:</ins>** This project focuses on survival prediction for HIV/AIDS patients based on clinical trial data. Using features such as treatment type and observation period, I applied multiple machine learning classifiers to predict patient outcomes and analyze the effectiveness of ZDV treatment.

**<ins>Purpose:</ins>** To evaluate the role of machine learning in medical prognosis and investigate treatment differences between ZDV and non-ZDV groups in terms of survival probability.

**<ins>Expected insights:</ins>** Reveals patterns in patient survival across treatment groups, demonstrates the predictive capability of various classifiers, and provides interpretable results to support healthcare research.

**<ins>Tech Stack:</ins>**

- Languages: Python
- Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree
- Libraries & Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

**[3. Gym Check-ins and User Metadata](https://github.com/maidinh2409/Gym-Check-ins-and-User-Metadata)**

**<ins>Description:</ins>** This project explores gym check-in behavior using a relational dataset that includes user metadata and location-based activity logs. The focus was on modeling structured data, performing complex queries, and generating visual insights across multiple dimensions.

**<ins>Purpose:</ins>** To practice data modeling, normalization, and multi-table querying, while transforming raw gym check-in data into meaningful business intelligence.

**<ins>Expected insights:</ins>** Uncovered trends in user activity across locations, peak usage times, and behavior patterns by user segment, visualized through interactive dashboards.

**<ins>Tech Stack:</ins>** MySQL, Tableau

**[4. Helmet-Wearing Object Image Classification using Deep Learning](https://github.com/maidinh2409/Helmet-Detection-Using-CNN)**

*[Try the model on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/demile2409/CSIS-3290-Helmet-Image-Classification)*

**<ins>Description:</ins>** Inspired by real-world safety concerns, this project tackles the challenge of detecting helmet use in images using deep learning. I built and trained a CNN on a custom dataset, enabling the model to distinguish between helmet and non-helmet cases with high accuracy. The final product is deployed as an interactive web app for real-time testing.

**<ins>Purpose:</ins>** To apply deep learning to a practical safety compliance problem and build a deployable solution for environments like construction sites and traffic monitoring.

**<ins>Expected insights:</ins>** Demonstrates how CNNs can effectively detect safety gear in real-world imagery and highlights the process of building an end-to-end ML productâ€”from training to deployment.

**<ins>Tech Stack:</ins>**

- Languages: Python
- Models: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Libraries & Tools: PyTorch, OpenCV, Gradio, Google Colab
